#Programming a computer seems complicated but in reality, it is just learning the commands #your
#computer understands so you can make it do what you want it to do. The material does this #to is
#data, that can be numbers, strings (sets of characters enclosed in ""), or a boolean which
#represents true and false, 0 or 1.
#In order for your computer to show text on a screen you must tell it what you want it to say with a
#print statement
#Ex1:
print("Hello World")
#Output would be: Hello World
# you can also capture strings and number and save them under names called variables:
greeting = "Hello World"
print(greeting)
#Output would be: Hello World
#Ex 2
#You can also take words user's input (or from other sources) and sub them into your string
#in the below example we have a variable that will save a users input for their favorite food:
fav_food = input("What is your favorite food?")
print("My favorite food is " + fav_food)
#OUTPUT:
#"What is your favorite food?: Burgers"
#My favorite food is


#assignment 1

Name = input("Hello Human. What is your name?")
print("Nice to meet you", Name)
